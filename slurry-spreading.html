      Ten tips for better Slurry Management
      </h2>
      <p>
      Some farmers have an easier time of it than others when it comes to slurry management. Giles Dadd is a specialist in slurry treatment and is agricultural consultant to slurry additive firm Epizym. Here, he offers some good advice on how to take the hassle and smell out of slurry and turn it into a valuable asset.

       <h3>
        1. See slurry as an asset.
       </h3>  
       <p>
        Slurry should not be seen as a problem but as a valuable asset. It not only adds organic matter to your soil and thus improves the soil structure, it can also increase water holding capacity and drought resistance in lighter and sandy soils. Based on recent prices for N, P and K fertilisers, the slurry produced by 100 dairy cows over the winter housing period has a potential value of almost £3,757. The slurry produced by a 1000-place finishing pig unit has a potential value of around £4,358 each year. †

        <h3>
        3. Get your slurry analysed
        </h3>
        <p>
        It’s important to understand the nutrient content of your slurry to enable reliable fertiliser planning. It’s best to measure or at least estimate this rather than rely on guesswork. Make sure the sample taken for analysis is the equivalent of an ‘average’ of what is found in your store. To do this, take several samples from various positions within the store, mix them together and then take a representative sub sample. This can then be analysed in a laboratory or be tested with a slurry N meter or slurry hydrometer on the farm.
       </p>

        <h3>
        5. Prepare your slurry properly
        </h3>
        <p>
        Significant savings on bought in fertiliser can be made if you maximise the fertiliser value of your slurry. Trial data from tests carried out in the UK and Europe shows that using a slurry additive can increase total-N in pig slurry systems by as much as 33% and ammonia-N by as much as 57%.  In cattle slurry systems, the figures are 11% and 51% respectively*. Using an additive can liquefy your slurry, making the consistency more even, and thus nutrient application more even on your land. Thinner slurry also means less time and energy spent on mixing and pumping, as surface crust and floor solids are greatly reduced.
        </p>
        <h3>
        7. Apply it evenly, using the right machinery
        </h3>
        <p>
        Slurry application must be of an even consistency to ensure nutrient applications are also even across the field. There are four main types of slurry distribution systems: broadcast spreader, band spreader, trailing shoe spreader, and injector. Using injectors or band spreaders will reduce ammonia loss and odour nuisance and enable more even spreading of slurry.
        </p>

        <h3>
        9. Use it correctly for what you farm
        </h3>
        <p>
        Silage grass requires much more potash than phosphate, making cattle slurry ideally suited. Using manures on grazing land can lead to problems such as rejection or recycling disease. Plan applications well in advance to maximise the use of your storage capacity, cropping, slurry nutrient values, soil types and keep within regulations. Calculate the supply of nutrients from your slurry, soil nutrient status, crop requirement for each field to give additional nutrients needed from the fertiliser bag.

        2. Get the right storage system
       </h3>
       <p>
        There is an increasing amount of advice available on the BPEX on how to build new pig buildings which reduce ammonia output. Under floor slatted tanks offer the highest potential for problems due to the inadequate removal of slurry solids during the emptying process. This gives a build up of solids which results in reduced storage capacity and added cost to remove the solids. It makes sense to design systems that offer the potential to remedy problems easily, whether in lagoons, slatted tanks etc. Make sure manure storage and handling systems are as simple as possible with the minimum of potential bottlenecks. Finally, using a slurry additive can significantly reduce crusting in storage tanks and ensure pumping and mixing can be carried out quickly and easily.
       </p>

       <h3>
        4. Understand the science
       </h3>
        <p>
        In very simple terms the potash is in the liquid fraction (urine based), the phosphate is within the solid fraction. The nitrogen is bound up in the solids fraction and in bacteria within the bacterial biomass (the volume of bacteria), as well as appearing in the liquid fraction. The availability of the nutrients to crops varies, but as a simple rule of thumb for untreated slurries, take up of potash is around 90%, phosphate 50% and nitrogen between 5% and 50%.
        </p>

        <h3>
        6. Spread it at the right time
        </h3>
        <p>
        Significant savings on bought in fertiliser can be made if you maximise the fertiliser value of your slurry. Trial data from tests carried out in the UK and Europe shows that using a slurry additive can increase total-N in pig slurry systems by as much as 33% and ammonia-N by as much as 57%.  In cattle slurry systems, the figures are 11% and 51% respectively*. Using an additive can liquefy your slurry, making the consistency more even, and thus nutrient application more even on your land. Thinner slurry also means less time and energy spent on mixing and pumping, as surface crust and floor solids are greatly reduced.
       </p>
       <h3>
        8. Keep the smell down
       </h3>
       <p>
        New IPPC regulations focus on odour control, making this a key focus for pig and poultry farmers. However, there’s a lot that can be done to minimise smell. For example, using a slurry additive can reduce odour by up to 55%*. Check the wind direction when spreading, and if your farm is in a residential area, don’t spread at the weekends or in the evening when people are at home. Finally, don’t spread slurries in excess of 50 m3/ha.
       </p>

       <h3>
        10. Keep up to date with regulation
       </h3>
       <p>
       Rules surrounding the storage and use of slurry are being updated regularly e.g. NVZ maximum rates of manure nitrogen per hectare per year. Keep abreast of these changes and update storage systems and processes in line with them to avoid cautions or expensive fines.
