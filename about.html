        In the 1950’s Eamon’s parents (John and Trina) purchased the farm on Attateenoe road.  The 200 acres were brought with Eamon’s Grandfather.  His name was Alan Kennedy, hence the name Kennedy Farm Limited which was established in 1966.</p>

      <p>In assisting to developing the flat  farm, John chose maize.  But when he had problems finding a reliable contractor to harvest his crop, he decided to purchase his own. That was Kennedy's first combine harvester. With the farm established, John and Eamon turned their skills to manufacturing and exporting spray units to Australia. As a teenager Eamon helped out in the workshop.</p>

      <p>Kevin slowly started to build the contracting division up, while Trina and John enjoyed sailing to the islands trips abroad.
      Like his Dad, Eamon had the need for a digger.  So he and his brother Michael went halves.  It was the first purchase of many under and the company Rural Contractors Limited was born.</p>

      <p>By the time Eamon and Lucy married in the early 2000’s the fleet had grown on the machinery side and the services Kennedy's could provide.  Eamon asked Lucy to help on the business, and today it boasts a considerable fleet, modern office and a Team that is renowned for their loyalty.</p>

      <p>In partnership to the contracting division, Kevin and Lucy manage their highly producing dairy farm.  They are aiming to achieve 500 milksolids per cow this coming season.</p>
