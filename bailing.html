     <h2> Baling & Wrapping</h2>
     <p>
     Since the introduction of the balewrapping system in the mid 1980's, baled silage has proved its ability to provide high quality, nutritious winter fodder with the added benefits of having reduced labour requirements, lower investment costs and more feeding flexibility than clamp silage. As such the practice of wrapping bales has been widely adopted in over 50 countries worldwide where it has helped farmers to feed their herds in an easy, cost-effective manner.
     </p>

     <p>
      Winter feed in the form of silage has always been a valuable resource but recent significant rises in animal feed costs have highlighted the need to maximise yields from baled silage in order to get the most out of the summer crop. If done correctly, wrapping bales in silage stretchfilm creates an airtight seal that creates an ideal ensiling environment for fermenting the crop. Furthermore, if cared for properly, bales retain their oxygen free condition throughout the storage period so that the silage is perfectly preserved until feed-out.
     </p>

     <p>
      Key to achieving good silage is the creation of dense, well shaped bales and the effectiveness of the airtight seal. Across the entire baling process from cutting to baling to wrapping to stacking and storing there are opportunities for inadequate care or poor practices to lead to spoilage and consequently wastage.
     </p>

     <p>
      A vital element of the balewrapping process is the selection of a high quality balewrap in order to provide the best protection possible. The essential requirements of a good balewrap are superior strength, effective tack properties and UV radiation protection each of which in turn provides good puncture resistance, an airtight seal and protection from sunlight. Good quality balewrap will withstand the rigours of high speed wrapping equipment and the stresses placed upon it during wrapping, transport and storage. Using a poor quality balewrap will result in stoppages, air ingress, inconsistent stretching and poor bale density.
